This app requests a number of permissions; some required, some optional.

Required permissions:<ul>
<li>Network (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, ACCESS_WIFI_STATE, INTERNET): Allows the app to fetch weather data from providers over the Internet</li>
<li>Background updates (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, WAKE_LOCK, FOREGROUND_SERVICE, SET_ALARM): Allows the app to refresh weather data in the background</li>
<li>Tile (EXPAND_STATUS_BAR): Allows the app to launch itself from Quick Settings</li>
</ul>

Optional permissions: <ul>
<li>Location (ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION): Allows the app to show weather in your current location</li>
<li>Storage (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE): Allows the app to set the live weather wallpaper and/or widgets on some devices</li>
<li>Ignore battery optimizations (REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS): Prevents the app from being killed in the background. Potentially more reliable method for fetching background weather data on some devices</li>
<li>Read phone state (READ_PHONE_STATE): Required by an app dependency: not actually used, but can't be removed. It's okay to never enable this.</li>
</ul>
