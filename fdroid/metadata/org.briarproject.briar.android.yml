AutoName: Briar
Description: |-
    Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else
    who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional
    messaging tools such as email, Twitter or Telegram, Briar doesn't rely on a
    central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices.
    If the Internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the
    information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the
    Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.
